Used to measure the lenght of an unknown piece of Coax, or where there is damage in a longer pice of coax.

Set only trace0 active
trace0 P0 > Format > more > linear
Transform > Low Pass Impulse
Turn Transform on
Set Velocity Factor (see velocity_factor.txt) as whole number (.80 velocity would be entered 80)
Start frequency = 50kHz
Stop Frequency = (5850/<max distance in Meters>) x VF
  VF is expressed here as .xxx
  The higher the freq, the shorter distance range but higher resolution
  The lower the freq, the longer the distance range
