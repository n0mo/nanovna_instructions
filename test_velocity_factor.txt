Full calibration must be completed

Will use Phase Angle on port1 trace to figure out the frequency range to get Peak to Peak.

Use over a 100MHz wide range to start, and then narrow if needed.

300/frequency=ELECTRICAL length in Meters.

Physical length in Meters / Electrical Length = velocity factor.
